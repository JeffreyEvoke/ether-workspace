## Session 2 — Afternoon (14:23 EST)

### Cron Jobs Configured
- **Professor Improvement Cycle** — every 30 mins, isolated session
- **Professor Summary Reports** — every 3 hours (00:00, 03:00, 06:00, 09:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00, 21:00)
- **Daily Workspace Backup** — 4:00 AM EST, commits and pushes to GitHub

### Workspace Backup
- Created private repo: `github.com/JeffreyEvoke/ether-workspace`
- Auto-backup cron job set up

### New Projects

#### Expro-StoreWiz
- Location: `/home/jeffreyevoke/.openclaw/workspace/Expro-StoreWiz`
- Uploaded to GitHub: `github.com/JeffreyEvoke/Expro-StoreWiz`
- Python inventory management app (PySide6)

#### Ether Portal (Web)
- Location: `/home/jeffreyevoke/.openclaw/workspace/ether-portal-web`
- Custom web dashboard for monitoring Ether
- Features: Dashboard, Chat, Jobs management, Activity log
- Served on port 8080 via Python http.server
- Still debugging WebSocket connection protocol issues

#### EtherPortal (React Native - abandoned)
- Started building Android app but switched to web portal
- Code exists at `/home/jeffreyevoke/.openclaw/workspace/EtherPortal`

### Gateway Config Changes
- `gateway.bind` set to `lan` (allows Tailscale connections)
- `gateway.auth.mode` set to `none` (no token required)
- `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` enabled
- Config keeps reverting — need to use `openclaw config set` command

### Issues Encountered
- Telegram blocked by Iraq ISP
- Gateway kept crashing due to port conflicts and config validation errors
- WebSocket protocol requires specific client ID, mode, and device identity
- Browser caching issues — used version query params to bust cache

### Lessons Learned
- Use `openclaw config set` instead of manually editing JSON
- Gateway requires `device.id` for WebSocket connections
- Valid client modes: ui, webchat, cli, backend, probe, test, node
